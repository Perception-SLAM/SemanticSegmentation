# Semantic Segmentation

During 2013 to 2016, I worked on the semantic segmentation problem. The goal was to understanding the semantic meaning of each pixel, including its object class and depth value. Over the years, we have developed several semantic segmentation algorithms. Our joint semantic segmentation and depth estimation work was awarded the best paper finalist by the Robotic Sciense and Systems conference in 2016.
